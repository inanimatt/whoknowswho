  /* This method exists to prevent multiple servers in the farm performing 
   * scheduled maintenance tasks more often than required. First, the task
   * sleeps for a random interval to limit race-conditions, then it queries
   * the memcache for the last time this event was run. If it was within 
   * 20 seconds of the last run, the method will return false and the 
   * calling task should stop processing.
   * 
   * It's important to note that this doesn't stop events running more than
   * once, just less than lots. It's to prevent database write-stampedes,
   * not to ensure that tasks only ever run once at a time. If this is even
   * slightly important to you, use something else (like a database, or a
   * dedicated task-running server).
